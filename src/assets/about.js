const about = {
    content:`I am Benjamin Chien, with one year of full-stack engineering experience. I excel at translating business logic into code and integrating systems.
    
    On 2023, I received front-end engineering training at Tibame and now continue to pursue knowledge in computer science, including studying CS50, data structures, and algorithms.
    
    During my time at National Chengchi University, I majored in Journalism, minored in History, and completed a Humanities and Creative Studies program. I also studied abroad in Finland. Beyond academics, I was actively involved in stage play production and volunteer work in rural communities.
    
    I am passionate about research, observation, and hands-on innovation in developing creative solutions. This led me to choose software engineering as my career path, which I pursue with dedication and enthusiasm.
    
    Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, watching baseball, practicing yoga, and reading. My goal is to maintain a balanced lifestyle that harmonizes professional growth with personal interests.`
